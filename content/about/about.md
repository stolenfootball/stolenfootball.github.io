I like sunsets, long walks on the beach, and classic literature.  The key to my heart is peanut butter ice cream.  Not like other computer nerds.

I specialize in low level computer security, spending a lot of time in both the capability development and incident response spaces.  Recently I've been studying insecure handling of IOCTLs in Windows Kernel drivers, as well as data leakage through abuse of speculative execution extensions in modern processors. 

My first area of study was forensics, and I have experience in both law enforcement and incident response areas.  The field is near and dear to my heart, and many of the posts here will be related to forensics.

Outside of cyber, I'm an avid hiker and archer, and try to spend as much of my time outside as possible.  

I've had a lot of help from some amazing people in my life, and love to give back to the community when I can.  If you find any of the posts on this blog helpful or interesting, please feel free to reach out.
