      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first forensics challenge of HackTheBox Uni CTF challenged participants to analyze a malicious JavaScript attachment that lead to VBS and PowerShell execution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The challenge description was as follows: Tasked with defending the antidote&amp;rsquo;s research, a diverse group of students united against a relentless cyber onslaught. As codes clashed and defenses were tested, their collective effort stood as humanity&amp;rsquo;s beacon, inching closer to safeguarding the research for the cure with every thwarted attack. A stealthy attack might have penetrated their defenses. Along with the Hackster&amp;rsquo;s University students, analyze the provided file so you can detect this attack in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
